                            <td>Michal Gabrukiewicz and a number of <a href="http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/about/">other contributors</a> created an awesome library for those using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">ASP Classic</a>. Michal passed away, but the site remained active.

                                <p>In mid-2013 the official site disappeared. I was able to contact one of the other programmers that worked with Michal and received permission to take ownership of the project. I've kept the <a href="http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/">official site</a> and the (now inactive) Google Code Project going since then.</p>

                                <p>With Google "retiring" Google Code, I set up <a href="https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed">an organization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed/asp-ajaxed">moved the code</a> to GitHub. There's a re-design for the official site in progress, and a move to GitHub pages, but no ETA as work, school, and life in general have curtailed some of my free time.</p>
