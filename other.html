                                created an awesome library for those using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">ASP Classic</a>.
                                Michal passed away, but the site remained active. In mid-2013 the official site disappeared.
                                I was able to contact one of the other programmers that worked with Michal and received permission to take ownership of the
                                project. I've kept the <a href="http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/">official site</a> and the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/">Google Code Project</a>
                                going since then. There is a planned re-design for the official site, but no ETA as work, school, and life in general have curtailed some of my free time.</td>

                                I looked through my options and settled on Snitz Forums. Since 13 July 2005 I've been an active member in the

                    <p>My sister, brother-in-law, and I are working on a new project together. We're still in the early planning phases, so there's not much to add here other than keep an eye out on my
                        blog for any mentions of our D20 Project.</p>
