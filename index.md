I wanted something other than my personal name to publish some of my solo development work under - and this was it. Here are some of the active projects I'm working on:

## AnonJr.com
![AnonJr Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/logo-anonjr.png){: class="logo-img"} [AnonJr.com](https://www.anonjr.com/) is my personal website. Almost everything I do online is under the "AnonJr" handle where I can get it. Here's where I keep the active updates and anything else that's going on.

## Bible By Example
![Bible By Example Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/logo-biblebyexample.png){: class="logo-img"} [Bible By Example]([BibleByExample.com](https://www.biblebyexample.com/)) is a podcast dedicated to covering Scripture in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This show is about going through the Christian scripture book by book, chapter by chapter, word for word - and we won’t skip the hard parts.

My goal is to do this in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This is not a preachy service, but a walk through what really is and isn’t in the scripture so we can have a constructive debate and not get distracted by arguing over things that aren’t really there in the first place.

I also want to be clear about what we will not be covering: we will not be going deep into the various issues and trivia that divide the different denominations. If there’s enough support on the Patreon page, I may set up a separate show for that purpose. This main podcast will remain centered around the core of Christian belief that is common to all denominations - what C. S. Lewis referred to as “Mere Christianity”.

(Still working on a more succinct explanation)
