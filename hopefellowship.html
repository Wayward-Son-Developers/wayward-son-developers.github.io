                    <h1>Hope Fellowship</h1>
                    <p>Hope Fellowship is a small church with a big heart for the Lord located in Bladen County, North Carolina, USA. They are a gathering of like-minded believers who 
                        share a desire to serve the community and reach out to those who are seeking Christ.</p>

                    <h2>Initial Designs</h2>
                    <p>Initially, I used a very customized fork of <a href="http://forum.snitz.com/">Snitz Forums</a> as the foundation for a dynamic and interactive site. Over the years 
                        there were a number of different designs with a variety of different features.</p>
                    <p>In January 2007 Hope Fellowship started recording some of the sermons and made them available online for anyone to listen.</p>

                    <h2>Moving to Google Apps</h2>
                    <p>Because they were getting more attempted spam than any other site I'd worked on, we shifted platforms to Google Sites - a part of their Google Apps account.</p>
                    <p>The new site is far simpler than any previous iteration, however it retains the features that were actually used and adds a more useful calendar of events.</p>
