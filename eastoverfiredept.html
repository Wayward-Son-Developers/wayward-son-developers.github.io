                    <h1>Eastover Fire Department</h1>
                    <p>Eastover Fire Department was established in May of 1956. In May of 2006 they launched the new website.</p>

                    <h2>Building The Site</h2>
                    <p>I started with a very customized fork of <a href="http://forum.snitz.com/">Snitz Forums</a> and used that as the foundation for a dynamic and interactive site.
                        Since then there have been a few adjustments and minor features added.</p>
                    <p>Since this site was developed after I had built the <a href="jesusjoshua.html">Jesus Joshua 24:15</a> site, it was far easier to build a site the department could keep up on their own.</p>

                    <h3>Updates, Etc.</h3>
                    <p>With work and family and life in general, things have been fairly quiet on the site - for them and me. I'm working on an updated "base package" for building sites and plan on
                        updating Eastover Fire Department's site with a new CMS and a new design as soon as the base package is finished.</p>
