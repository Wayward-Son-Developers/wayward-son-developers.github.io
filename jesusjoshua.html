                    <h1>Jesus Joshua 24:15</h1>
                    <p>Jesus Joshua 24:15 is a local Christian Rock group with a big heart for the Lord. I've been helping them with their website since... a while.</p>

                    <h2>Early Days</h2>
                    <p>Somewhere in 2001/2002 I needed a project for one of my web programming classes. Fortunately, my friends in the band needed a new website.</p>
                    <p>The first version I put together was a step up from what was there before, but still fairly simple. Over the years I continually tweaked and adjusted as the needs of the
                        band changed and as my skill level grew.</p>

                    <h2>2006 Re-design</h2>
                    <p>In 2006 Jesus Joshua 24:15 wanted a completely redesigned site to correspond with their new album release. This became the first iteration of the current design.</p>
                    <p>I started with a very customized fork of <a href="http://forum.snitz.com/">Snitz Forums</a> and used that as the foundation for a more dynamic and interactive site.
                        Since then there have been a few adjustments and various new features added.</p>

                    <h3>Updates, Etc.</h3>
                    <p>With work and family and life in general, things have been fairly quiet on the site - for them and me. I'm working on an updated "base package" for building sites and the band
                        will be the first to get the new CMS and a new design.</p>
