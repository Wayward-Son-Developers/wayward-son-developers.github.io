## Games Revisited
Games Revisited is my "Let's Play" series where I go through classic games I played in my youth (or games from around the same timeframe that I missed). The goal is a brisk pace, but not a speed run - I want to enjoy the game and offer those who haven't played a good look at the story and experience.

Season 8 was put on hiatus due to a depressive episode and later a fight with cancer. For Season 08 of Games Revisited, I returned to the SNES via emulator to play &ldquo;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&rdquo;. Prior to the hiatus I used [BSNES](https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes) for emulation, after the hiatus I used BSNES as a part of [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/).

All episodes are over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw). I do a live-to-tape marathon recording session for the next week's episodes on [my Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live). (When I get back to streaming)

## CoffeeCraft.us
![CoffeeCraft Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/logo-coffeecraft.png){: class="logo-img"} CoffeeCraft is a small, [HermitCraft](http://hermitcraft.com/)-like Minecraft server and podcast built with my sister, her husband, and a mutual friend. The four of us planned on posting weekly videos independently, a few live streams, and a few collaborative projects.

We're currently on hiatus. A live stream archive and other videos are over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw). You can watch the live streams there or on [my Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live). (When I get back to streaming)

More information is over at [CoffeeCraft.us](https://www.coffeecraft.us/).

## Minecraft Resource Packs
I fancied a change of pace with some minor aspects of the game, so I put together a pair of Resource Packs - custom voices for [Villagers](https://youtu.be/A3yHT_e2Y9s) and [Wandering Traders](https://youtu.be/X3CFnlJ2ebk). All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnonJr), and the completed packs are available for [download on Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/anonjr/submissions) too. I may add more as the whim strikes, but since my cancer journey I haven't really been back to Minecraft.

## ASP-Ajaxed
![ASP-Ajaxed Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/logo-aspajaxed.png){: class="logo-img"} Michal Gabrukiewicz and a number of [other contributors](http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/about/) created an awesome library for those using [ASP Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages). I used it in many different projects. Michal passed away, but the site remained active.

In mid-2013 the official site disappeared. I was able to contact one of the other programmers that worked with Michal and received permission to take ownership of the project. I'd kept the [official site](http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/) and the (now inactive) Google Code Project going since then. With Google "retiring" Google Code, I set up [an organization](https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed) and [moved the code](https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed/asp-ajaxed) to GitHub. There was a re-design for the official site in progress, and a move to GitHub pages, but no ETA as this project got lost in the shuffle of life. With Microsoft sunsetting Classic ASP, I'm not sure if there's good reason to finish the migration to GitHub Pages and fix a few outstanding issues in need of mending.
