## Snitz Forums (as [AnonJr](https://forum.snitz.com/forum/Account/Detail/AnonJr))
![Snitz Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/logo-snitzforums.gif){: class="logo-img"} Back in 2004, my boss asked me to integrate a support forum into our <acronym title="Learning Management System">LMS</acronym>. Since the system was written in [ASP Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages), I looked through my options and settled on [Snitz Forums](https://forum.snitz.com/). From July 2005 on until development work on the LMS halted, I'd been an active member in the [support forums](https://forum.snitz.com/forum/AllForums) for this project - helping others, contributing various extensions, and working with the core dev team on the 3.4.07 release.

For some time this forum package became the foundation for several sites. I'd even started work on a fork, scratching a few itches and such. Sadly I never did finish due to some health issues halting much of my dev work.

## Jesus Joshua 24:15
![Jesus Joshua 24:15 Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/jesusjoshua2415.png){: class="logo-img"} [Jesus Joshua 24:15](https://web.archive.org/web/20250719105619/http://jesusjoshua2415.com/) was a local (to where I lived at the time) Christian Rock group with a big heart for the Lord. I'd helped them with their website since&hellip; a while. Somewhere in 2001/2002 I needed a project for one of my web programming classes. Fortunately, my friends in the band needed a new website. The first version I put together was a step up from what was there before, but still fairly simple. Over the years I continually tweaked and adjusted as the needs of the band changed and as my skill level grew.

In 2006 Jesus Joshua 24:15 wanted a completely redesigned site to correspond with their new album release. This became the first iteration of what would be the last design. Life took over, and a prolonged hiatus became a permanent hiatus for the band. I still keep in touch though.

## Eastover Fire Department
![Eastover Fire Department Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/EastoverFD.png){: class="logo-img"} In May of 2006 Eastover Fire Department wanted to [launch a website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217055311/http://eastoverfd.com/). I started with a very customized fork of Snitz Forums and used that as the foundation for a dynamic and interactive site. Over time a few adjustments and minor features were added. Since this site was developed after I had built the Jesus Joshua 24:15 site, it was far easier to build a site the department could keep up on their own. One of the more distinguishing features they had was a nice little time line of the Department's history.

As of 2016, the department decided to take down the site.

## Hope Fellowship
![Hope Fellowship Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/HopeFellowship.png){: class="logo-img"} Hope Fellowship is a small church with a big heart for the Lord located in Bladen County, North Carolina, USA. They are a gathering of like-minded believers who share a desire to serve the community and reach out to those who are seeking Christ. Initially, I used a very customized fork of Snitz Forums as the foundation for a dynamic and interactive site. Over the years there were a number of different designs with a variety of different features.

Because they were getting more attempted spam than any other site I'd worked on, we shifted platforms to Google Sites - a part of their Google Apps account. That version was far simpler than any previous iteration, however it retained the features that were actually used and added a more useful calendar of events.

When I left Hope Fellowship for a different church, no one took over the website and it eventually went away.

## Stack Overflow (as [AnonJr](http://stackoverflow.com/users/25163/anonjr))

As my job duties shifted away from dev work, and the community shifted in more politically active ways, I dropped off from active engagement with the Stack Exchange network as a whole. I do still occasionally find the answers I'm looking for there.
